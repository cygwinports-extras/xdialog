sdesc: "X11 replacement for dialog"
ldesc: "Xdialog is designed to be a drop in replacement for the dialog 
or cdialog programs. It converts any terminal based program into a 
program with an X-windows interface. The dialogs are easier to see and 
use while adding even more functionalities (e.g. with the treeview, the 
file selector, the edit box, the range box, the help button/box)."
